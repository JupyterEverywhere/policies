<h2 id="services">1. Our Services</h2>

Our Services enable you to explore data science and coding. You can use our tools to create and run Jupyter notebooks, analyze data with Python or R, visualize results, share your work through links, and much more.

By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and to the collection, processing, and use of your information as described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use our Services.

Our Services include the following “Jupyter Everywhere Tools”:

- Simple JE Tools: web-based versions of Jupyter notebooks that run entirely in the browser without an account or installation, including support for Python and R.

- Advanced JE Tools: features that allow users to save and share notebooks with links, notebooks for editing, and other future tools to come.

Certain of our Jupyter Everywhere Tools are designed to be managed by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, school systems, teachers, or other instructors (collectively referred to as *“Schools”*) for the benefit of students of such Schools (*“Students”*).


<h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility and Authority</h2>

If you are using Jupyter Everywhere on behalf of a School and/or directing Students to use Jupyter Everywhere, then you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School and you agree to these Terms on the School’s behalf. In addition, in such circumstances, each reference to “you” in these Terms shall be deemed to refer to the School. Each such School hereby agrees it is responsible for the use of the Jupyter Everywhere Services by such School’s personnel and Students in accordance with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

We require that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to Students and their parents/guardians regarding use of Jupyter Everywhere. Please note that if your Students are under the age of digital consent in the applicable jurisdiction (the age of 13 in the U.S., in accordance with Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (**“COPPA”**)), you must obtain verifiable parental/guardian consent to the Terms and our Privacy Policy prior to your Students’ use of our Services. If you are acting on behalf of a School that is providing access to Students or directing Student to access the Service, then you, on behalf of the School, represent and warrant that the School has received verifiable consent from the parent or guardian of the Student, or has gained the authority to provide consent on behalf of Students, for these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

If you are using our Services independently from a School, then you agree to these Terms on your own behalf.

<h2 id="personal-information">3. Personal Information and Student Data</h2>

Section 3 applies to a School’s use of Jupyter Everywhere. If you are a School teacher, Student, or parent/guardian of a Student, you may also refer to the [Student Data Privacy Statement](/studentdata), and if executed by the School and Jupyter Everywhere, our School Data Processing Addendum (**“DPA”**).

When Jupyter Everywhere is used by a School for an educational purpose, Jupyter Everywhere may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the Student. **“Student Data”** is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include “educational records” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (**“FERPA”**), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g).

**Confidentiality**. Jupyter Everywhere agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as described in these Terms, and in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and [Student Data Privacy Statement](/studentdata), and if executed by the School and Jupyter Everywhere, our DPA.

**Student Data Access**. You authorize Jupyter Everywhere to access or collect Student Data for the purpose of providing the Services. In the U.S., Jupyter Everywhere shall collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). As between the parties, the School or the Student owns and controls the Student Data. Jupyter Everywhere does not own or control, or license such Student Data, except as to provide the Service and as described in these Terms, our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and [Student Data Privacy Statement](/studentdata), and if executed by the School and Jupyter Everywhere, our DPA.

**Personal Information and Student Data Consents and Authority**. If you are a School representative, you represent and warrant that you have provided appropriate disclosures to your School and to parents regarding your sharing such personal information with Jupyter Everywhere. Both the School and Jupyter Everywhere hereby agree to uphold their respective obligations under FERPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (**“PPRA”**), COPPA and applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and if executed by your school and Jupyter Everywhere, our School Data Processing Addendum. Jupyter Everywhere relies on each School to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, for Jupyter Everywhere to collect any Student Data, including the collection of Student Data directly from Students under the age of 13, or the applicable age of digital majority in the Student’s jurisdiction. We recommend that Schools provide a copy of the Jupyter Everywhere [Student Data Privacy Statement](/studentdata) to each Student’s parent/guardian. Each School hereby agrees to comply with these Terms and all laws and regulations governing the protection of personal information, including children’s information, and the sharing of student education records.

**Use of Student Data**. By submitting or providing us access to Student Data, you agree that Jupyter Everywhere may use the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School’s consent. **Jupyter Everywhere shall not use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.**

**Use of Anonymized Student Data**. You agree that we may collect and use data derived from Student Data for our own purposes, such as for product development, research analytics, and marketing our Service, provided that (i) such data will be de-identified and/or aggregated to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual and (ii) Jupyter Everywhere will seek to impose contractual limits on any third parties with access to de-identified data preventing reidentification of de-identified data.

**Use of Personal Information for Marketing**. You agree that Jupyter Everywhere may provide customized, relevant marketing messaging for Jupyter Everywhere and Jupyter Everywhere partner products and services to Schools or School representatives and teachers from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data. For emphasis, and without limitation, Jupyter Everywhere shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.

**Third-Party Service Providers**. You acknowledge and agree that Jupyter Everywhere may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers, which have a legitimate need to access such information in order to provide their services to us. We and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such Student Data.

**Data Breach Notification**. In the event we have a reasonable, good faith belief that an unauthorized party has gained access to or been disclosed Student Data (a **“Security Event”**), that we have collected or received through the Service, we will promptly notify the School. If, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of Jupyter Everywhere or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws. With respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of Jupyter Everywhere or its agents, Jupyter Everywhere shall reasonably cooperate with School’s investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at School’s reasonable expense. Jupyter Everywhere shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to any notebook that are not associated with a School.

<h2 id="responsibilities">4. Your Responsibilities</h2>

<h2 id="termination">9. Termination and Suspension</h2>

Without limiting other remedies, Jupyter Everywhere may terminate, prohibit, or suspend your access to all or part of the Jupyter Everywhere Services without notice if Jupyter Everywhere believes that you have violated these Terms or have engaged in conduct that violates applicable law or is otherwise harmful to the interests of Jupyter Everywhere, any other Jupyter Everywhere Services user, or any third party. You may discontinue your use of the Jupyter Everywhere Services at any time.

<h2 id="fees">10. Fees</h2>

Jupyter Everywhere reserves the right to charge fees for access to new Jupyter Everywhere Services.

<h2 id="disclaimer">13. Disclaimer and Limitations of Liability</h2>

a. You agree that use of the Jupyter Everywhere services is at your sole risk. The Jupyter Everywhere services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.

You acknowledge that access to data and materials (including, but not limited to, your or others’ user submissions and generated materials) available through the Jupyter Everywhere services is not guaranteed and that Jupyter Everywhere will not be responsible to you for any loss of data or materials caused by the Jupyter Everywhere services or their unavailability.

b. Under no circumstances will Jupyter Everywhere or its officers, employees, directors, shareholders, agents, creators, partners, or licensors be liable under any theory of liability (whether in contract, tort, statutory, or otherwise) for any damages whatsoever, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of money, revenues, profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if such parties were advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the Jupyter Everywhere services.

Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that Jupyter Everywhere may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Jupyter Everywhere’ liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

<h2 id="indemnification">14. Indemnification</h2>

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jupyter Everywhere and its officers, employees, directors, shareholders, agents, creators, partners, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your notebook) violation of these Terms.
