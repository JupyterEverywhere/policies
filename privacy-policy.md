a. **Personal Data You Disclose to Us**. You can use all of our Services without registering for an account with Jupyter Everywhere. If you choose to communicate with Jupyter Everywhere, you may provide to Jupyter Everywhere certain information by which someone could personally identify you, such as your name and email(**“Personally Identifiable Information”**), and similar information used for access (**“Security Information”**).
